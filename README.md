## LyricRecycleGenerator

My LyricRecycleGenerator is supposed to be hosted on a website, accessible to everyone. It gives the user the opportunity to generate new lyrical content by either accessing text files already stored on the site or uploading files to work with. You then define a template the program should work with to generate a new text.

An example would be

verses to create: 2
choruses to create: 1
Number of characters:55-64

these are the parameters you have set for text creation, the rest is done by random creation.

Once you have a first result you still can alter it by choosing sentences you want to be exchanged by others randomly chosen from the vault.

The end-result will then be read out by a text-to-speech generator. If I get it done, I#d like to alter the pitch, while doing so, so the app could “sing”.
